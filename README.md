# Code_Quiz

This is my code quiz.

Users are presented with a start screen, where they can start the quiz or view the high scores. Upon starting the quiz, users are presented with 5 questions that are presented in random order. If the user chooses the right answer, the answer box background turns green, a "Correct!" message appears, and the score updates. If an incorrect answer is selected, the answer box background turns red, an "Incorrect!" message appears, and the timer decreases by 10 seconds. 

Once the timer runs out or all 5 questions have been answered, the user is taken to the end game page, where they can enter their name and save it to the high scores page. Then they can restart the game or view the high scores. On the high scores page, scores are shown in descending score order. The user can also clear the score board.

I completed this exercise with the help of the Youtube series from James Q. Quick.
